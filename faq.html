                    <!-- faq answer -->
                    <div class="faq-body">
                        <p>If you have to move because of one thing or another all you have to do is contact us a month before moving out,
                          so that we are able to terminate your contract.
                            After the termination of your contract you WILL NOT be charget for rent !</p>

                    <!-- faq answer -->
                    <div class="faq-body">
                        <p>If you cannot make the payment on time, just mail us that you won`t be able to pay,
                            this will be a tremendous help for you, because we won`t have the need to contact you about this.
                            However, make sure that you DO NOT do this for every single month, because we will have to fine you or worst case scenario - terminate your contract !</p>
